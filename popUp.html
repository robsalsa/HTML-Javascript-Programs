  <p>                                                                                          
    Although we share the same family name, I am not in any way
    related to the famous (or is it infamous) adventurer, Bilbo.
    I have a lovely wife, Elvira, and two grown children, Max
    and Miriam. Max has chosen to follow me in my profession,
    which is described below. Miriam is a beekeeper for the town
    bookkeeper, who keeps bees as a second job.
    I am employed by Forest Keepers, Limited. My job, as I understand
    it, is to keep an eye on the 4 acres of wild cranberries that
    grow in the swamp at the edge of the village forest. I am required
    to file a daily report, in triplicate, on the condition of the
    cranberry bushes. To accomplish my task, I walk by and inspect
    every cranberry bush in the swamp every workday. My employer provides
    me with wading boots for my job. I pick up the boots at the office
    every weekday morning and turn them back in, after a thorough
    cleaning, after each workday.
